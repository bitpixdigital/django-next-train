# django-next-train
**A lightweight public transit Django app for finding "next train" times in the Washington DC Metro system.**

## Purpose ##
While many mobile apps provide transit times, they are often slow, loaded advertisements and/or suffer from poor interface design.
All of these factors can cause one to "miss the train" when simply attempting to retrieve the information.

The purpose of Next Train is to display transit information in a *__fast, lightweight manner__*.

Next Train DC will load quickly on the main page without requiring a login and will work as a web app on any mobile phone
or within any Django project.

Another great feature of Next Train is the ability to select and display information for multiple stations in one click, which makes it
easier and faster to calculate the timing of a connecting train.

## Example ##

## Roadmap ##

This is the very first release, but I hope to add the following features soon.

- Add an alert system for outages and disruptions
- Add transit information for additional cities.
- ~~Add login functionality so that users can save their train line preferences and have them auto selected in the station list.~~ *(completed 7/6/16)*

## Contributions ##

This is my first project on GitHub and I welcome all contributions from anyone interested in this project. If you're looking to get
your feet wet as a contributor, I could definitely use help in adding transit information for additional cities beyond Washington DC.
